<p> Hello friends and family! </p>

<p>I am sitting at the gate waiting to board for my overnight flight to Tahiti. Once I land tomorrow at 5am, I then take a ferry over to Gump Station on Mo'orea, where my program begins. I am feeling antsy, but not full blown anxious. I am trying to remind myself whatever the feelings– they should be largely understood as excitement. These 10 weeks feel like an incredibly unique experience where I don’t have to be responsible for anyone or anything besides myself. What a gift! The feeling of independence combined with self-absorption feels like a fleeting feeling that will become less and less accessible the older I become, and I am hoping this is the sweet spot (or that I am wrong). But mostly just excited for the wonderful new adventure awaiting.  </p>

<p> I am unsure what register to use when I write these “posts”. I fear I am running into my inevitable conundrum of the icebreaker: how much do I share/how personal? I am a consistent journaler, and I surely do not want this to become a freeflow of my inner thoughts (I will spare you). However, I may not be able to be in close contact with as many people as I usually am, and as we all know, I have a lot to say. I suppose we will go where the wind takes us.  </p>

<p> I believe another conundrum is that I am still in the phase of never wanting to be wrong or misunderstood– and putting something in writing for people to read feels quite permanent. Even worse is that you may not like my writing or my thoughts– but I suppose that is not really my problem. It’s about time I do away with the fear of being misunderstood, it takes up a lot of brain space that could be used thinking of Friedreich Hundertwasser or Hannah Arendt.  </p>

<p> I had a wonderful month, and felt incredibly grateful for the life that my parents have and continue to give me as well as the community that has surrounded us for my entire life. On my 21st birthday (thursday!) I was full of gratitude for those around me and the person I am becoming. It feels really awesome to continue to grow older and grow alongside those I love. I always feel connected to “little Rebekah”, and I think she is pleased with how this is all going (phew.) Although I don’t think I could live in Redlands full time again, I am so grateful it is where I can come home to and have the opportunity to soak in the beautiful mountains and the way they change color and clarity throughout the day and the seasons.  </p>

<p> But being home is still really hard and the toll that it takes. This morning as I was packing for my trip, I paused to take my mom to the bathroom, but she fell and I couldn’t protect her head before it hit the wall. It wasn’t a harsh fall or harsh contact with the wall– but such a simple task is so daunting given how fragile her skull is. It is a horrible feeling of failure whenever she falls, no matter how many times I have successfully transported her. Not to mention the day to day hardships and heartbreak that comes with her confusion and cognitive decline. Despite this she is still beaming with love and it is always a treat to hear her laugh when it comes out.  </p>


<p> All of this to say, I head into this adventure holding all that exists, and feeling very grateful for the love, and trying to acknowledge the hardship. I am very grateful that you are willing to read my thoughts and I hope that you are doing well, in a full sense or in a momentary one, and that your mountains (theoretical or literal) are changing with clarity and color with you and your seasons!  </p>

<p> Talk soon! </p>
<p> Rebekah  </p>
