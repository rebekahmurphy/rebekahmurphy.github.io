    <h1>Sunday, January 25, 2026 </h1>
<p> Hello friends and family,</p>   

<p> It is difficult to believe it has only been a week– but it also feels like I’ve just arrived. This feels like a common contradiction in my life these days. I hope to write these more frequently because to write about my entire week in one sitting feels unachievable. But I’m very glad I didn’t– I have spent most of the week entirely off of my phone, only needing to charge it once, browsing on it for 10 minutes a bit in the morning and night. It feels wonderful. </p>

<p> Once we landed in Tahiti, the fellow students on the flight and I made our way to the port to wait for our 10:30am ride, a tough feat given that it was 5:30am. Despite the time the port was full with mostly teenagers from the Society Islands (Thaiti, Mo’orea, Raiatea, Huahine, Tha’a, and Maupiti), and they were playing music on speakers and running around.  I later learned that Mo’orea does not have school above 10th grade on the island and teenagers have to take the 5am ferry to Tahiti and get home about 6pm, so they were most likely on their morning commute. Not only teenagers, but once a boat would dock there would be about 100+ people already on their motorbikes, who swarmed out the port together and headed to work. It reminded me of the Ferry connecting Amsterdam Noord to Amsterdam (but the Tahiti one was a bit cooler I have to say). </p>

<p> Most of the group had arrived at this point and we walked over to the Papeete market, which was only just beginning to open up, but it was clear that in a few hours this would be a dynamic space. It was interesting to be in the capital of French Polynesia, even if it was only for a few groggy hours, seen through my sleep deprived eyes. It was the first taste of a sense that I have maintained this past week: The French influence remains strong, as well as the poverty and residue from colonialism remain. We learned later in class that the homeless on Tahiti are mostly people who left their home islands searching for work, but didn’t find any and don’t have enough money to return home. The city grid itself was European, with the same cars and streets. Obviously this was a very quick glance, and I hope to learn more in the coming weeks. </p>

<p> Once we arrived at the port in Mo’orea it was incredibly vibrant, and the different people from Gump Station and our program helped us get our luggage and get onto the bus to take us to Hirinaki Beach. Yes, I should specify here that we are not staying at Gump Station the entire time (my bad!), but we will be staying there beginning February 14th until the end of the program. The bus ride over was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. The abruptness of the mountains, which are really just decaying volcano formations, lie so close to the vibrant crystal blue water that your eyes and head begin to disagree with the direction they should be looking towards. Here is how I described it in my journal a day or so after we arrived, </p>

<p>      “on the bus ride from the port to the beach house I sat in the back with the open window opposite from the ocean soaking in the jagged mountains, loosely glancing over at the beautiful bright sea. The wind was blowing through everyone's hair as we winded along the only paved road on the island. I looked around the bus and saw that at that moment there were no phones in sight. The chattering from before had turned quiet and everyone was trying their best to soak in the moment of awe and beauty. Once we turned off of the main road we slowed, because the dirt roads had mini lakes (also known as puddles), with the branches coming through the windows to meet our faces.”</p>

<p>  A similar feeling was held once we arrived in Hirinaki– a beach front property with a saltwater pool just for kicks and giggles. I know I’ve gone to a place like this in my mind when I need to be somewhere else, but now that daydream is beneath my feet. There is spotty wifi here, so I don’t want to attempt to upload photos just yet, but I hope that my words can do justice before you can see for yourself. There are what I can best describe as huts, connected by an indoor/ outdoor walkway. At one end is the living room/kitchen, where we gather for “class” and meals, and on the other end is the room I am staying in with eleven other girls. I was one of the lucky five that got a bedframe, but there is a room where they are just sleeping on small mattresses. All of the roofs are made out of Pandanus, a leaf that undergoes being soaked and then dried, and then weaved to be very durable and waterproof. Luckily the eleven person room has our own bathroom, which is a beautiful stone shower and the Pandanus is exposed, rather than in our room where there is plaster covering it. However, a family of birds have taken shelter in it, and we’ve watched it slowly decay as they pick it apart for their birds nest. It made for an epic first shower, where I had the window open to watch the Pacific ocean, and birds flying in and out overhead. But throughout the week there have been mysterious colored globs falling from the above sprinkled around… </p>

<p> The “schedule” for this past week begins in the morning for breakfast, followed by a check in and some sort of class. There is always an hour or so in the afternoon leaving just enough time to walk in the water and snorkel. When they told us to be flexible, they truly meant it, and everything feels very relaxed and easy going, which has allowed for ample reading between classes. But when I say class, some of this has included: collecting shells on the beach, or flower crown making (I have no future in either weaving Panndanus nor flower crown making). Hannah, our program director is so well connected on the island that we have had a lot of cool people come and speak, such as a grad student from the New School of French Polynesia who gave us a presentation on Island Formation and the Nuclear Bomb testing that the French did from the 50s until the mid 90s. Our assistant program director is named Jennifer and she is a local who grew up in Mo’orea and is a part of the French Polyensian cultural revival. Jennifer is also really well connected, and it seems that we will be hearing from a wide variety of people on the island and multiple perspectives. Hannah Stewart is currently working for an organization called Coral Gardeners but has been a scientist at Gump Station and a variety of other insane projects for many years. She developed this program in response to “helicopter research" that she saw, where people come to Gump Station, do their project as quickly as possible, and go home to write it up. As a part of our assignments, we have to write a reflection each day, and an hour long observation each week. Once we have been on the island for two weeks, Hannah will still be our program director, but we will have different professors cycling through for our two week courses. The next class is supposed to be taught by someone who works at the Smithsonian, but that may be canceled if the government shuts down, because then he would not be able to travel (obviously much worse for the state of our country than the state of my program). There are twenty students here, all very kind and cool. Per someone’s suggestion we began to do a slideshow where each night three people introduce who they are. This has been interesting and goofy, but at times the “humble brag” is apparent. One guy went for an entire hour, and it got to a point where no one could contain their giggles (and maybe my snort came out) when another photo of something he ate was unironically shown on the screen.</p>

<p> We haven’t seen the sun since our arrival to Mo’orea. For a few days we were on the edge of a cyclone moving through nearby.. Tuesday night the wind and rain were so loud I had trouble sleeping, hoping the tin material had been hammered in tightly enough on the roof. Despite the lack of sun, the overcast is still bright and it creates a dramatic aura around the mountains. The rain and clouds are most dramatic when we are out snorkeling. Interestingly, the tides are controlled by the Sun, not the Moon here– and the waves influence the currents more than the Sun. Mo’orea has a barrier reef because the island has been eroding, so we have a wonderful lagoon to break the waves far out. One day Emerson (my snorkel buddy, as well as general buddy) and I were out close to the reef break, with a heavy current, and the rain came gushing down so intensely I could barely see him. It was awesome. The fish all come out in the rain, and we’ve been seeing so many beautiful vibrant colors. Emerson spotted a Blacktip Shark, and I saw it slowly moving in the murky distance, made even more ominous by my foggy goggles. We also saw two turtles, and a flounder. It turns out turtles are very ineffective eaters, at least the one that we watched for perhaps 15 minutes, as it struggled to get a good bite. </p>

<p> On the first day of our official classes, Hannah read to us the first chapter from “Hawaii” by James A. Michener. We were all sitting in the deep couches in the living room, with gusts of wind blowing through and a mixture of heavy rain followed by light showers. Stray dogs and the stray cat we have accidentally adopted were roaming through, begging for pets that we happily obliged. It was such an impactful moment, I felt like a kid again being read to, and felt so safe despite the events outside. I felt my body begin to unclench itself, a state I forget that I am constantly in. </p>




<p> Before I leave you, I want to share some of my favorite quotes from Italo Calvino’s “Six Memos for the Next Millenimum”, which I have been cautiously devouring, knowing my first time reading it will be too short. The most impactful memo so far has been “Lightness”, which I hope is available to you online. I highly recommend that you read it, I find it to be so valuable. 
Here is one of my favorite quotes, to spark your curiosity and hopefully desire to read,“At this point we must remind ourselves that the idea that the world is made up of weightless atoms surprises us because we have experienced the weight of things. Similarly, we could not admire the lightness of language if we had not also learned to admire language endowed with weight” (18). It must have been so exhilarating to be on the precipice for the new Millennium, what an event to witness as a human being. Learning about island formation over the past few days has been a gentle reminder to how momentary humans are within the lifetime of the Earth, and how astonishing it is that we even exist. Hannah told me she has been seeing corals (or the algae on corals, I forgot) changing their behavior after a bleaching event, and are showing signs of adapting to the new conditions. It is such an excellent example of how the earth is resilient, it is us who are not. It makes me think more about the Apocalyptic nature of our society, how we think everything is going to burn, which it might, but eventually the ash will begin to turn into life again, we just might never see it. We can’t conceptualize time in the way it actually works, only in relation to ourselves and our mortality. I don’t say this as a critique, but rather as context that feels weirdly comforting. Anyways, just some thoughts rattling in my brain. Calvino has been an excellent companion this first week. The science we learn is nothing without the poets alongside us. My last quote was just too topical to leave out, because he refers to the dreaded straight line in his memo entitled: Quickness. “I might say I prefer to entrust myself to the straight line, in the hopes that it will continue on into infinity and make me unreachable”(57). You can have your own thoughts on this of course, but why live to infinity only to be unreachable? </p>

<p> Anyways, again, thank you for reading about my experiences and my thoughts. Of course there are many things I sadly had to leave out, but that will make the anticipation for the next time we see each other even more fresh and lovely. I look forward to that time. Until then, I hope that you have had moments of awe in some shape or form recently, and that you read some of the memos!! Tell me what you think. </p>

<p> Until next time, </p>
<p> Rebekah </p>
